Not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground (like hey I found this) especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth. Also, the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu.Also, small things like not being able to rotate the camera or change the location of the tent are annoying.IDK to it seems like Nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth.

You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible.

Not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground (like hey I found this) especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth. Also, the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu.Also, small things like not being able to rotate the camera or change the location of the tent are annoying.IDK to it seems like Nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth.

Out of all theFirst off let me say that the 1 Island per Switch argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way.

Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way.

Out of all theFirst off let me say that the 1 Island per Switch argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way.

       "3 First off let me say that the 1 Island per Switch argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all theFirst off let me say that the 1 Island per Switch argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!… Expand\n",

       "1 My gf started playing before me. No option to create my own island and guys, being the 2nd player to start on a console SUCKS!!!! You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do.

Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do.
